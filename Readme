##Readme file###
This script is aimed to act as an alternative to Rasa core. I donot claim this to be a replacement of rasa core in any way. I wanted to have a function to deliver me the 
message as a string parsed from the core to my script which seemed to be not possible using the core. So I have written a small file so as to mimic the core. This 
script is more of a rigid version to the rasa core, and works on flowchat rather than stories.md. One needs to feed the script with prior data for it to work. 
It works on a domain similar to the domain file of the rasa core, and an actions.py file similar to rasa core with minor changes. Following are the changes to be done to the 
main domain and action .py files.


-In the domain file, every intent needs to be mapped properly with action or utter keyword for it, as it doesnot have a stories.md to work on. I will be working to improve the
code in future iterations.
-In the actions file you have to build slot_data={} dict manually for the core to use. One can build a different logic around it, though. one has to build the tracker class as
well with atleast one function.
- At the end of the action file you need to create an array of objects of classes to be triggered named obj_arr=[] which is to be imported to the core file.
